# Decisions

## Phase 1 Decisions

### DOM overlays over canvas drawing
Used positioned `<div>` elements for SoM overlays instead of canvas. DOM overlays are more reliable across SPAs and don't require canvas coordinate mapping.

### CDP for accessibility tree
Playwright's `page.accessibility.snapshot()` API was removed in newer versions. Using Chrome DevTools Protocol directly via `page.context().newCDPSession(page)` for reliable accessibility tree extraction.

### Single session per server
One `BrowserContext` + one `Page` per server instance. Simplifies state management. `resetSession()` creates a fresh context when needed.

### No bundler
Using `tsc` directly. No webpack/esbuild needed for MVP. Keeps build simple.

### stderr logging
MCP uses stdout for JSON-RPC. All logs go to stderr to avoid protocol contamination.

### Video recording via Playwright built-in
Using Playwright's `recordVideo` context option rather than a custom recording solution. Each session gets its own subdirectory.

### Stdio transport only
MCP over stdio (JSON-RPC 2.0) for MVP. HTTP/SSE transport deferred to future work.

## Phase 2 Decisions

### BrowseAgentic naming
Project renamed from OmniBrowser to BrowseAgentic. All config, types, and env vars updated. Old `omnibrowser.yaml` kept for backward compatibility but `browseagentic.yaml` is the canonical config.

### Config v2 structure
New config sections added: `budget`, `cache`, `rsi`, `tabs`, `session`. Old `security.allowed_paths`/`blocked_paths`/`allowed_commands` moved to `rsi` section. Old `server.console_level`/`secrets` moved to `security` section.

### Per-tab buffers (breaking change)
`SessionState.console_log_buffer` and `network_failure_buffer` changed from flat arrays to `Map<number, string[]>` keyed by tab_id. All tools updated to use `session.active_tab_id` for buffer access.

### Pruning modules extracted
AOM pipeline split into `pruning/paint-order.ts`, `pruning/role-pruning.ts`, `pruning/text-coalesce.ts`. Each is an independently testable pure function. Main `aom.ts` chains them in order.

### Response budget (partial implementation)
Budget system implemented with element cap (20) and text truncation (4000 chars). Full 4-step layered shrink (console→image→elements→text) deferred — current implementation is sufficient for typical pages.

### Cache TTL
Cache entries expire after `cache.ttl_hours` (default 168 = 1 week). Checked on read, stale entries auto-deleted. Prevents serving stale selectors from redesigned sites.

### RSI sandbox root
All RSI tools resolve paths relative to `rsi.sandbox_root` (default: `.`). Path traversal, symlink escapes, and protected patterns all enforced through `path_guard.ts`.

### Binary file detection
`read_file` checks first 8KB for null bytes. Binary files rejected with `BINARY_FILE` error. Prevents dumping garbage into agent context.

### eval_js XSS modes
Three modes: `warn` (default, logs warnings), `block` (rejects dangerous scripts), `off` (no detection). Configurable via `security.eval_js_xss_detection`. Not a security boundary — just a tripwire for accidental self-harm.

### Session persistence caveat
Profile files contain live session cookies. No encryption at rest in Phase 2. Documented limitation — operator's responsibility to secure the profiles directory.

### Multi-tab popup auto-registration
New tabs opened via `target="_blank"` or `window.open()` are automatically registered via `context.on('page')` event. Agent informed via `new_tab_opened` field in interact response.

## Prior Art Research
Key patterns adopted from 8 repos via deep source code analysis:
- microsoft/playwright-mcp: YAML output, depth limiting, generic pruning, console filtering, secret redaction
- browser-use/browser-use: RectUnion paint-order filtering, 99% containment threshold
- browserbase/stagehand: Action caching with SHA-256 keys, variable substitution, self-heal
- vercel-labs/agent-browser: Compact tree algorithm, StaticText merging, invisible char stripping
- Skyvern-AI/skyvern: PUA character replacement, name truncation, URL compression
- remorses/playwriter: Color-coded overlays by element type
- badchars/mcp-browser: Basic XSS detection, structured network logging
- alexrwilliam/playwright-mcp-server: Response budget system, layered capping

## Definition of Done — Reference Verification (Phase 21)

Verified against Antigravity IDE v1.22.2/v1.23.2 browser automation capabilities:

| Capability | Antigravity 1.x | BrowseAgentic | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spawn browser | Chrome extension drives user's Chrome | Playwright-spawned OR CDP connect | EXCEEDS |
| Navigate to URL (incl. localhost) | Navigates to local dev server | `navigate` + dev_mode | PARITY |
| Click/fill forms | browserClickElement, browserInput | `interact` (click/type/hover/clear) + caching | EXCEEDS |
| Take screenshots | captureBrowserScreenshot | `observe_page` vision (color-coded SoM) | EXCEEDS |
| Loop back to fix | Relies on IDE editor | RSI tools (read/write/exec/git) | EXCEEDS |
| Real-time feedback | Console log capture | Console + network capture | EXCEEDS |
| Permission tiers | Likely not in 1.22.2/1.23.2 | Not implemented | CONFIRMED OUT OF SCOPE |

**Conclusion:** BrowseAgentic has reached feature parity with Antigravity 1.x browser automation. All capabilities are at parity or better. The one confirmed gap (permission tiers) is not in the reference build and is correctly out of scope.

**Dev mode added:** `dev_mode.enabled: true` allows localhost access for agentic dev loops while maintaining security defaults for general browsing.

**Standalone tool note:** BrowseAgentic is a standalone MCP server usable by any agent framework. It is not tied to a specific agent or IDE.
